Every time a new dev needed to add onboarding instructions, they had
to change intellij and eclipse
The problem was, there was a difference between the data "what needed to be onboarded",
and the process of onboarding</aside></div></section><section><div class="fragment"><p>Refactored</p><div style="background:#777;"> <img src="resources/refactoring_1.png" class="noborder"/></div><aside class="notes">We pulled the IDE onboarding instructions out, they were just data

to change navigation, we were manipulating classes that were constructing jlabels
When we need the ability for people to jump into a context for migration,
the code for this got really gross, so we made each view dumb.
Views only respond to and generate events and show sub-views. They don't transition
to new states. This is heirarchical, so subviews are dumb, but the higher level view
might have some controller logic</aside></div></section><section><div class="fragment"><p>dumb-views</p><div style="background:#777;"><img src="resources/refactoring_2_needs.png" class="noborder"/></div></div></section><section><div class="fragment"><p>Conclusions</p><ul><li class="fragment">"object oriented"</li><li class="fragment">cohesion -- best practices</li></ul></div></section>
