    We used to build the IDE onboarding instructions per IDE.
    Every time a new dev needed to add onboarding instructions, they had
    to change intellij and eclipse
    The problem was, there was a difference between the data "what needed to be onboarded",
    and the process of onboarding

    We pulled the IDE onboarding instructions out, they were just data
    now each IDE responds to data independently

    Another example: our view owned our controller, any time we wanted
    to change navigation, we were manipulating classes that were constructing jlabels
    When we need the ability for people to jump into a context for migration,
    the code for this got really gross, so we made each view dumb.
    Views only respond to and generate events and show sub-views. They don't transition
    to new states. This is heirarchical, so subviews are dumb, but the higher level view
    might have some controller logic
